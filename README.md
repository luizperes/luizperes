### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You probably realized I am not very publicly active on GitHub this year. Here is why:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my masters thesis at [@sfu](https://github.com/sfu) and you can see it [here](https://cs-git-research.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/cameron/parabix-devel/-/blob/master/tools/json/json.cpp).
  - If you're here, you've probably heard of [simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson), my thesis is a JSON parser that takes a few core concepts from simdjson and improve its performance even further by using the [Parabix Framework](https://cs-git-research.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/cameron/parabix-devel).
- ðŸ’» I'm currently working as a full-time iOS Engineer at [Tribe Property Technologies (Former bazinga! Techonologies)](https://github.com/bazingatechnologies).

My main interests are in compilers, programming paradigms and mobile development.
