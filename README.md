### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ If you're here, chances are you've heard of [simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson), my thesis is a JSON parser that takes a few core concepts from simdjson and improves its performance even further by using the [Parabix Framework](https://cs-git-research.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/cameron/parabix-devel).
  - Here is my [masters thesis](https://summit.sfu.ca/item/36072) at [@sfu](https://github.com/sfu). You can see the work implementation [here](https://cs-git-research.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/cameron/parabix-devel/-/blob/master/tools/json/json.cpp).
